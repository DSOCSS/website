            For Fall 2024, Dartmouth Computer Science Society will be posting weekly puzzles for you all to think about.
            We might decide to have a small prize for whoever solves the most during the term! This weekly puzzle series is maintained by Ribhu Hooja.

        <p>Week 2 has two puzzles!</p>

                    Puzzle #1: You and your friends are prisoners, and you will be allowed to leave if you win the following game. 
                    There is a chessboard with coins on each square, randomly heads or tails. One square is special, and you are told that square. 
                    You get to flip ONE coin on the board (out of 64). Then your friend comes in and has to deduce the position of the 
                    special square just from the configuration. You are allowed to plan in advance, but neither of you know the arrangement 
                    of the coins on the board before you see it (i.e. your friend won't be able to tell which coin you flipped just from 
                    looking at the board and comparing with the expected board). How do you win?

                Puzzle #2: The code in <a href="https://github.com/ribhuhooja/stiff-puzzle">this repository</a> (or, in a slightly different form, attached to this email) 
                is a boiling-down of <a href="https://github.com/ajoohuhbir/breakout-basic">this repository</a> of mine. In the puzzle version, only the paddle is there that 
                you are supposed to move around with the A and D keys. The movement is (supposed-to-be) physics-based, 
                in the sense that when you press the key it applies a force, which produces an acceleration, which changes 
                velocity which ultimately changes the coordinates. When no key is pressed, the velocity is taken away by a
                 proportional drag force. However, there's a problem. When you press a key, the block moves as it's supposed to. 
                As soon as you release, though, the block disappears and python crashes. What's going on?

        <p class="mediumText">Week 1</p>
        <p>
            I want to start off the term with one of my favorites.
            I think this one is really elegant because the solution is not very complicated,
            yet if you don't know it it feels impossible.

                    You baked some cookies and want to send them over mail to your friend.
                    Unfortunately, the postman will open any unlocked package and eat the cookies.
                    You have a padlock and chain that you can wrap around the box to keep it from being opened, and your friend has one too.
                    But you have different locks and keys; your key cannot open your friend's lock and vice-versa.
                    The postman is a retired logician and if at any point he can gain access to the cookies, he will
                    (so no sending the key in an unlocked box over mail first).
                    How do you make sure your friend can eat your cookies and the postman cannot steal them?

                        The puzzle is solved by mailing the package back-and-forth a few times:<br>
                        1. Put the cookies in your box and lock it with your padlock. Mail it to your friend.<br>
                        2. Upon recieving the package, your friend will lock the box with their padlock and send it back to you, with the package being locked by both of your locks.<br>
                        3. Once you get the package again, remove your lock with your key and mail it back to your friend. The package only has your friend's lock on it.<br>
                        4. When your friend gets your package they can remove their lock with their key and get the cookies.
